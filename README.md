# NavigationDemo
This is the simplest possible demo of Android Navigation Component.

To clone the project, go to the desired directory and on terminal type:

    git clone https://github.com/sulavtimsina/NavigationDemo.git
    

Open the project in Android Studio.

The application has two activities, first is the MainActivity which is just a launcher activity. 
Clicking on the "Hello World" button in it will take you to the main Navigation Activity. 
To see how the navigation is laid out, see the file res/navigation/nav_graph.xml in design mode.
